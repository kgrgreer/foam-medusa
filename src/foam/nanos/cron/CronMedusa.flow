<title>CronMedusa</title>
<p>Medusa splits cronjobdao into crondao and cronjobdao.</p>
CronJobDAO now only has 'running' crons. Clustering is disabled, and the numerous updates are not persisted in medusa.
CronDAO holds all crons, any edits, enabling/disabling occurs here.
When a cron is enabled it is copied to cronjobdao.
